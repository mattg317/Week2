# Gradebook

Create a grade calculator using **conditionals**. This calculator will convert your numeric grade to a letter grade, and style the resulting cell accordingly.

## Instructions

* Using `unsolved_color.xlsm` as a starting point, create a button that, when pressed, will run a script that does the following:

  * If the score is 90 or greater, the student will receive an "A" in the letter grade cell, and the Pass/Warning/Fail cell will be filled green with the text "Pass".

  * If the score is between 80 and 89 (inclusive), the student will receive a "B" in the letter grade cell, and the Pass/Warning/Fail cell will be filled green with the text "Pass".

  * If the score is between 70 and 79 (inclusive), the student will receive a "C" in the letter grade cell, and the Pass/Warning/Fail cell will be filled yellow with the text "Warning".

  * Finally, if the score is below a 70, the student will receive a "F" in the letter grade cell, and the Pass/Warning/Fail cell will be filled red with the text "Fail".

## BONUS

* Create a second button that will reset the grades to our original state and add the previous result as the "Last Grade" in a separate cell.
