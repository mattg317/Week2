You are tasked with with some quick data analysis of our solar system.

## Instructions

* Create a script that loop that will loop through the data.

* You results should return the total number of planets, the total mass of all the planets (using the Earth's mass as the standard unit of measurement), and the average number of moons per planet.

## Bonus

* In column H, `Diameter Difference from Earth`, use a for-loop to populate the column with the difference of that row’s planet with the earth’s diameter.
