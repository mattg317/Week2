# The VBA Lotto

It looks like a large amount of people participated in this week's lotto and you, as our new head of the lotto commission, will need to find our three big winners!

## Instructions

* You are in charge of finding our winners for a local lotto drawing.

  * The results are, in order:

    * First: 3957481
    * Second: 5865187
    * Third: 2817729

  * Create a script that will return those lucky winners and print them on the sheet.

    * The first row should have three extra columns:

      * First name
      * Last name
      * The winning number

    * They should be placed in winning order of First, Second, Third.

    * There should also be a message box that congratulates the first place winner.

## Bonus

* There's also a chance for three lucky runner up winners:

  * 2275339
  * 5868182
  * 1841402

* Whoever comes up first will be our fourth place winner.

* Print them to the sheet as well.

## Hint

* Look to see what you can store in a variable to help clean up your code.
